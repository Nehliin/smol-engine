### Smol 3D Engine experiments
This was a project used to learn 3D graphical programming, it began with the render logic implemented using open gl and then migrated to wgpu.
It uses the wgpu-render-node project but both are currently abandoned in favor for the development of the open source experimental RTS game which instead supports multi threaded rendering. It also uses more pure rust dependencies. 

That project uses what I learened from this and the wgpu-render-node projects (with updated dependencies) and is better built.
